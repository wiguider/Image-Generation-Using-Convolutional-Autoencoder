An **autoencoder** is a neural network that is trained to attempt to copy its input to its output. Internally, it has a hidden layer ***h*** that describes a **code** used to represent the input. The network may be viewed as consisting of two parts: an ``encoder`` function ***h***=*f(***x***)* and a ``decoder`` that produces a reconstruction r=*g*(***h***). If an autoencoder succeeds in simply learning to set *g(f(***x***))* = ***x*** everywhere, then it is not especially useful. Instead, autoencoders are designed to be unable to learn to copy perfectly. Usually they are restricted in ways that allow them to copy only approximately, and to copy only input that resembles the training data. Because the model is forced to prioritize which aspects of the input should be copied, it often learns useful properties of the data. [[1]](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## **Image Autoencoder**

This project introduces an example of a ``convolutional (variational) autoencoder`` that reads an input image, encodes the image into a lower dimensional latent representation, then decodes the latent representation to reconstruct the imput image.
The autoencoder is implemented using the [Keras](https://keras.io/), and it is based on convolutional neural networks leveraging [Conv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/) layers in the ``encoder``, and [Conv2DTranspose](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d_transpose/) layers in the ``decoder``.
The autoencoder is trained using the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset. Each image in this dataset is 28x28 pixels. For this reason, the input shape of the ``encoder`` was set to ``(28, 28, 1)`` as well as for the output shape of the ``decoder``.

## Scripts

* ``conv_autoencoder.py``: contains the implementation of a Convolutional Autoencoder and a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder.

* ``train_conv_autoencoder.py``: trains the selected autoencoder model on the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset, and saves the weights and parameters of the model under the selected directory (in this case, the trained convolutional autoencoder is saved under ``model`` and the variational autoencoder is saved under ``variational/model``) in the project folder.

* ``generator.py``: loads the saved model and runs it on a random sample from the test set to generate similar images, and plots their latent representations.
